            I am 20 years old Business Information Systems -student. I made this portfolio because I wanted that people could see my skills, projects and works. It was really nice to make this page but it was also very hard job.

            So I study Business Information Systems in University of Applied Sciences. I am specializing to software programming. I like programming and I have made many many many little programs by myself. When I graduate I want to work with the best programmers in the world.
